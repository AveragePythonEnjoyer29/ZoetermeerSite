The lab
Future and education go hand in hand, that's why in the Lab you will find the future of games and learn how you are part of that future. Be surprised by the museum's educational projects in schools and at workshops where the latest technology is explained and taught. The Lab is a dynamic space. From admiring game art to traveling through new worlds. There is always something new to experience in the Lab: sometimes you can learn all about the history of gaming during a lecture and sometimes we welcome you during a tournament or a meet-up. Experience the future of gaming, or shape it yourself in the Lab!
