                        A garage box in The Hague is the place where the adventure started in 2008, with two friends Hasan Tasdemir and Pascal Rappailles. The garage quickly became too small, after which they moved to a warehouse on an industrial estate. Unfortunately, the shed was not heated and everything had to be transferred to an empty Ministry of Agriculture in the middle of winter. When this building also had to be cleared out, the then collection of 10 arcade video games was stored with some spare parts in an old showroom for classic cars. Because there was no room to renovate or play with the cabinets, suitable space was looked for.

                        Museum section is limited but awesome. Foods and drinks are a tad over prized. Best arcade experience ever and incredibly friendly staff. Definitely worth the visit outside of The Hague. I’ll definitely go back again and again!

                        The best arcade in all of the country. I come here to enjoy games that aren’t easily found anywhere else, Beatmania IIDX specifically. great fun! The staff are super friendly and attentive. Toilets could be a bit more cleaner (toilet seat cleaner would be nice to add).

                        We went with our company. It's amazing, so much to chose from. Really nostalgic. You can go two hours for 12,50 or 4 for just 17,50. And the best thing even tough it's crowded you can always play something, because there is so much to chose from, and you don't need any coins for the machines. You can play as long and much as you like. The staff is good and nice too. Will be coming back here in September with friends as well.
